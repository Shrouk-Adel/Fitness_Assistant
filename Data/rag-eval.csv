"*   **Latissimus Dorsi**
*   **Biceps**",7,What muscles are primarily targeted during the Lat Pulldown exercise?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly identifies the Latissimus Dorsi as the primary muscle targeted during lat pulldowns.  However, while the biceps are involved, they are secondary assisting muscles, not the primary focus.  Therefore, the inclusion of biceps diminishes the overall accuracy and makes the answer only partly relevant."
*   Lie on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand.,126,Can you describe the position I should be in while performing Dumbbell Flyes?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer provides a single, minimal instruction on the starting position for dumbbell flyes.  It lacks crucial details about arm positioning, hand placement, and body alignment which are essential for proper form and to avoid injury.  While it's a part of the answer, it is far from complete."

"To perform the Arnold Press, you need:

*   Dumbbells",68,What equipment do I need to perform the Arnold Press?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly identifies dumbbells as necessary equipment for the Arnold Press. However, it is incomplete as the Arnold Press can also be performed with other equipment like resistance bands or machines.  A more complete answer would list various options."
"Yes, calf raises primarily target the calves. However, other exercises like High Knees and Jumping Jacks also activate the calves. Additionally, exercises like Jumping Squats can activate the calves.",30,Can calf raises target any other body parts besides the calves?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly states that calf raises primarily target the calves, addressing part of the question. However, the question asks if calf raises target *other* body parts besides calves, and the answer instead lists other exercises that also work the calves.  It doesn't explain if calf raises themselves activate other muscles.  Therefore, it's only partly relevant."
"During the Smith Machine Row, you should:

*   Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
*   Bend forward at the hips.
*   Row the bar towards your torso.",159,What specific action should I take with my arms during the Smith Machine Row?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer provides instructions for performing a Smith Machine Row, but it fails to address the specific question regarding arm positioning. While the instruction to 'Row the bar towards your torso' implies some arm movement, it lacks the detail and specificity needed to be considered fully relevant.  The answer focuses on overall posture and movement rather than the specific arm action."
*   **Primary Body Part:** Lower Body,24,What is the primary body part targeted by Step-Ups?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly identifies the lower body as the primary target. However, it lacks specificity.  'Lower body' encompasses many muscles (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves).  A more relevant answer would specify the primary muscle groups worked, such as quadriceps and glutes."

*   Latissimus Dorsi
*   Biceps",203,What muscles does the Machine Lat Pulldown primarily target?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly identifies the Latissimus Dorsi as a primary target muscle of the Lat Pulldown. However, while the biceps are involved, they are a secondary muscle group, not a primary target.  Including the biceps as a primary target is inaccurate and diminishes the overall relevance."
"To perform the Smith Machine Row, you need a Smith Machine.",159,What equipment do I need to perform the Smith Machine Row?,NON_RELEVANT,"While technically true that a Smith Machine is needed, the answer is insufficient.  The question implies a need for a more comprehensive list of equipment, potentially including things like weight plates, a spotter (depending on experience), and potentially a weightlifting belt. The response is far too simplistic and doesn't address the user's likely intent."
